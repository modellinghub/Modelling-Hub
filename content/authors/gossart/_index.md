I am a regional climate modeller at the National Modelling Hub since 2020. I use the Polar version of the Weather Research & Forecasting Model (P-WRF) to understand processes and interactions between the atmosphere and the surface if the Antarctic Ice Sheet, which includes surface mass balance components such as surface melt, precipitation events, blowing snow,... I also supervise a PhD student studying air temperature-surface melt relations and empirical parametization.
Recently, together with Alena Malyarenko, we have coupled the atmosphere PWRF model to the ocean MITgcm model (that includes sea ice). We are using this tool to study air-ocean and sea ice interactions over the Ross Sea domain. The coupled P-SKRIPS model is able to accurately simulate polynyas and sea ice extent for the present day. Our future projects include exploring the sensitivity of the climate of the Ross Sea to warmer conditions (in the frame of the ASP projects goals) and to various paleo-settings (past climate and past ice sheet configuration) with our PhD student.
