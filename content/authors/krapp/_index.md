Mario is an environmental data scientist and interested in (almost) everything related to the Earth system. Mario spends his days figuring out how we can we learn from data, how we can better integrate models and data, and how we can make informed decision using the best of both worlds. To do that he is building statistical models that incorporate machine learning and our prior knowledge about the underlying Earth system processes. Examples are future contributions of Antarctica to global sea level rise or past climate sensitivities inferred from the geological record. Mario's tools of trade are programming (Python, C/C++, FORTRAN, Julia, and sometimes R), mathematical and statistical modelling (regression, ordinary differential equations, spectral analysis), and a solid understanding of the Earth system (atmosphere, ocean, ice, land, biosphere).

Mario is currently involved in the Antarctic Science Platform and the MBIE Endeavour programme *Te Ao Hurihuri: Te Ao Hou, Our Changing Coast* of programming (Python) combined with a (relatively) solid mathematical intuition.
